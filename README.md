# Band-Gap
Predicting Band Gap of Alloys based on their Crystal Structure with the help of Machine Learning Architecture. I used the BAND GAP DATA SET from https://citrination.com/datasets/1160/show_files/

My model predicted the band gaps of different alloys with an accuracy of 84.6278%. I would also suggest to go through the tutorial by Nanohubtechtalks on youtube to guide you through the project.
